        <h1>Dumb Animals</h1>
        <h2>2.Ostriches</h2>
        <p> Yes I get it, <i>technically</i> Ostriches are birds but I'm ust going to club it under animals ok??</p>
        <p>Let's begin with General facts, shall we?  </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The flightless ostrich is the world's largest bird (One of the biggest birds in the world is the ostrich. It stands out for more reasons than just its size. It is the quickest bird since it lacks wings and has powerful legs.)</li>
        <li>Ostriches have three stomachs</li>
        <li>Unlike all other living birds, the ostrich secretes urine separately from poop. (I don't know why I included this, potty jokes I guess)</li>
        <li>Male territorial battles for a harem of two to seven females usually last only a few minutes, but they can quickly result in severe brain collisions.</li>
        <li><div>Ostriches participate in an intricate mating ritual that involves the cock flapping his wings constantly until he attracts a partner. Once this happens, they will proceed to the mating area, and the cock will chase away any intruders.. (This fact is going to stay with you guys throughout this read)</div></li>
      </ol>
  <div>
    <p>So apparently, their reaction to threat is what this whole thing is about. That's why they're dumbâ€¦ otherwise apparently they're reasonably smart. So what makes them so dumb-</p>
  </div>
  <div> 
    <h2>When scared, this bird gets down and falls to the ground, then lays its head and neck in front. In some instances, they bury their heads in the sand and assume they cannot be noticed by the predators.</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
  <p>Lovely.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Seriously- what!</h2>
