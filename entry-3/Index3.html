        <h1>Dumb Animals</h1>
        <h2>2.Ostriches</h2>
        <p> Yes I get it, <i>technically</i> Ostriches are birds but I'm ust going to club it under animals ok??</p>
        <p>Let's begin with General facts, shall we?  </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The flightless ostrich is the world's largest bird</li>
        <li>Ostriches have three stomachs</li>
        <li>Unlike all other living birds, the ostrich secretes urine separately from poop. (I don't know why I included this, potty jokes I guess)</li>
        <li>Male territorial battles for a harem of two to seven females usually last only a few minutes, but they can quickly result in severe brain collisions.</li>
        <li><div>Ostriches participate in an intricate mating ritual that involves the cock flapping his wings constantly until he attracts a partner. Once this happens, they will proceed to the mating area, and the cock will chase away any intruders.. (This fact is going to stay with you guys throughout this read)</div></li>
      </ol>
