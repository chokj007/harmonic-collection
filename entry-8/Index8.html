                <h5>Chameleons actually change their color due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment. 
                    Chameleons have eyes in the backs of their heads
                    Chameleons have extremely powerful tongues
                    Most chameleons are tree huggers 
                    Chameleons take a while to hatch and don’t live very long

            <p>Chameleons <nobr>are so dumb</nobr> that even domesticated chamel&shy;eons have a hard time surviving in their tanks or cages.
            </p>

            <p>When setting up their homes, owners of these <nobr>colorful creatures</nobr> must take great caution. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Since they like the feeling of burning I guess, chamel&shy;eons are known to intent&shy;ionally and at the same time unintention&shy;ally  burn themselves. </p>

            <p>
                Yup, before a chameleon realizes what it is doing, it will have already touched a hot bulb, lamp or surface. In a matter of seconds, the heat can burn its skin, causing lesions. The chameleon should be kept VERY far away from them because it can stretch itself <nobr>really far.</nobr>
            </p>

            <p>
                Imagine stretching just to reach an object that is going to burn you.<nobr>The extra effort for pain. </nobr>
            </p>
            <p class="colorchange">Why... </p>

            <p>When it comes to water, a Chameleon is a very stupid animal. <nobr> Even in a shallow dish of water, it can </nobr> effect&shy;ively drown in <nobr>inches of water.</nobr>
            </p>
            <img src="Openmouth.jpg" class="m3" alt="OpenMouth">

            <p>Something else that should be disallowed near them, are sharp edges-not the obvious kind, even pointy bits of mesh, because these animals have a record of <nobr>injuring themselves.</nobr>
            </p>

            <img src="Openmouth.jpg" class="m2" alt="OpenMouth">

            <p>When it comes to moving around, chamel&shy;eons are not the most perceptive of animals. They have a reputation for getting trapped in odd places. A chameleon has occasionally gotten trapped between a potted plant and the dish it was standing in. Additionally, they have a history of falling into their own cages,<nobr >and breaking their bones very easily. </nobr></p>

            <p class="swinging">Chameleons appear to be in danger all the time, in general. Exposure to extremes of heat and cold, interactions with other pets and wild animals, consumption of harmful substances, slips and falls, being stuck, touching hot objects, and, if domesticated, being crushed between doors, windows, and machinery. I feel like these <nobr>things can’t catch a break.</nobr>
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Walking around unsupervised is the number one accidental death for chamel&shy;eons. <nobr>So…Ummmm...this says alot. </nobr>
