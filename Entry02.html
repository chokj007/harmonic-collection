        <h1>Dumb Animals</h1>
        <h2>Animals are just like <i>us!</i></h2>
        <p>I adore all animals, and while some of them are intelligent enough to know better, some only want to win the Dumbest Animal Award. Like humans, the presence of a brain does not preclude the presence of mental agility. Unmistakably proving that animals can be just as foolish as humans are the animals in the entries explored. These entries provide us the chance to ponder why and how while taking a fun look at some of the less-than-intelligent traits of animals.</p>
        <h2>1.Koala</h2>
