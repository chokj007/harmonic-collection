        <h1>Dumb Animals</h1>
        <h2>Animals are just like <i>us!</i></h2>
        <p>I adore all animals, and while some of them are intelligent enough to know better, some only want to win the Dumbest Animal Award. Like humans, the presence of a brain does not preclude the presence of mental agility. Unmistakably proving that animals can be just as foolish as humans are the animals in the entries explored. These entries provide us the chance to ponder why and how while taking a fun look at some of the less-than-intelligent traits of animals.</p>
        <h2>1.Koala</h2>
        <p>First of all, we must look at these creatures with wonder casue they're so adoarble!</p>

     <p>To get started, let's begin with a few general Koala facts. </p>
    <p>We love to observe these beauties from Australia, the iconic marsupial, the koala or in more technical terms- Phascolarctos cinereus. Slowly it's becoming more and more difficult to see wild koalas in their native habitat, but from time to time we manage to find them by following the amazing (and kinda strange) roars of the male. </p>
    <p>To list a few more interesting facts: </p>
    <ol>
    <li>The medium-sized marsupial,Â koala lives in the eucalyptus woods on Australia's east coast. Koalas may reach lengths of up to 2.8 feet (60-85 cm). The female may weigh up to 17 lbs. and the male up to 30 lbs. (13.5 kg) (7.9kg).</li>
    <li>Koalas can sleep up to 22 hours a day (18-22)!</li>
    <li>They're solitary animals! Koalas like to spend their time alone </li>
    <li>Koalas are born hairless, blind and without ears (When a koala joey is born, they are the size of a peanut)</li> 
    <li>Koala can live for more than a decade </li>
    <li>(Weird one) Koalas' fingerprints resemble those of humans</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now for the intellectual material. 
    In comparison to other mammals, the koala has one of the lowest brain-to-body mass ratios. Koalas have lasted despite their stupidity because their brains use little energy. So essentally their brains are really small and because they treat themselves to toxic ecualyptus leaves,low on nutriton and energy, they operate on really low energy, which would explain the sleep that lasts for over 90% of the day! </p>
