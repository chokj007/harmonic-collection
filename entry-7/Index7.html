        <h2>7. Emus</h2>

        <h3>*Hihihi* I just like birds... but also there's a saying for being dumb and it's literally "Birdbrain". </h3>
        <p>(I'm not saying I beleive the saying...it's just...well-fitting for some birds)</p>

        <h3>General facts:</h3>

    <section class="flex-container">

    <div>
    Emus have big bodies and tiny wings.
    </div>
        
    <div> 
    They are the only birds with calf muscles.
    </div>

    <div>
    They are covered in soft fluffy feathers.
    </div>

    <div>
    They have excellent swimming, high jumping, and running skills. 
    </div>

    <div>
     Males raise the chicks and hatch the eggs.
    </div>

    <div class="help">

    </div>

    </section>

    <main>

        <p>Even though ostriches are known for not being particularly smart animals, emus are even less intelligent than their larger, flightless relatives. </p>

        <p> I think Emu's may loose the war this time...</p>

        <p>A hard hitting claim comes from a biologist and comparative psychologist, Louis Lefebvre of McGill University: "Emus are the least intelligent birds in all of Australia". When he showed up on an Australian radio program, he received a call from a listener who recounted a story of being in the outback with some natives, who told him that if he lay down on his back and elevated his foot, the emus would come to investigate, assuming he was one of them.
        </p>

        <p>Emus kinda fail to adjusting to new conditions and are almost unable to teach themselves new methods of surviving.</p>

        <p>Despite their reputation for being nosy, they aren't actually capable of acting on the information they seem to be taking in. It's just weird...</p>

        <p>Emus may have a tendency for weird behavior, but this does not make them more productive or change their surroundings.</p>

        <p>Tim Nielsen, who manages the birds at the Royal Adelaide Zoo, has a colleague who was working in remote New South Wales who told him one such story, supporting the present current argument. The colleague observed an emu running parallel to his car and the fence as he was traveling down an old road. He moved up quickly out of curiosity, stopped, and kept watching the emu, which was now some hundred meters away. The emu continued to sprint in the direction of the car and when it arrived at it...<div class="pop-out-in"> ran directly into it, knocking itself out. </div></p>

        <p class="help">I just keep getting animals who like knocking themselves unconscious or getting brain damage.</p>

        <p>Therefore, it should not come as a surprise to hear that emus have a relatively small brain; reports of their severe idiocy are not unusual. Tim once assisted a vet with an emu autopsy, and the two of them had trouble even finding the animal's brain. (It was eventually found though)
        </p> 

        <p>Emus may be easily tricked, according to a former Dubbo emu breeder. All one had to do to avoid an emu attack was to hold a stick over their head. They start think you are bigger than they are, and so they run away. </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p class="big">They're the peak example of a birdbrain because they don't learn and run into moving cars.</p>
