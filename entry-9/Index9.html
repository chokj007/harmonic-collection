                <ol>
                    <li>Chickens are living descendants of dinosaurs. </li>
                    <li>Chickens can dream.</li>
                    <li>Chickens have better color vision than humans.</li>
                    <li>Chickens have great memories.</li>
                   <li>Chickens bathe by covering themselves in dirt.</li>
                   <li> Chickens have complex communication.</li>

        <main>
            <p>Chickens are notorious&shy;ly un&shy;intelligent; they're best known for having bodies that can function without even having heads attached <nobr>to them.</nobr> 
            </p>

            <p>Even while some chicken owners would <nobr>try to claim</nobr> that chickens have a lot of emotional and innate intel&shy;ligence, <nobr>that is </nobr>almost rarely the case. In the Northwest, a chicken owner confessed, "I don't believe I had any un&shy;reasonable expect&shy;ations here, but I've been taken away by exactly how not-smart chickens are. I've decided your average chicken is packing about as much processing power as a <nobr>VIC-20.</nobr> You know, 5 kilobytes of RAM <nobr>and a</nobr> <nobr>BASIC interpreter</nobr>.”
            </p>

            <p>They reiterate how much they love the animal... and so essential&shy;ly, this is basically equivalent to a parent calling their own child stupid. 
            </p>

            <p>Chickens exhibit a wide range of idiocy, much like people. In their own gated coops, some hens can go lost. Some of the more stupid ones <nobr>have a tendency </nobr>to be highly co&shy;-dependent and become agitated when sepa&shy;rated from the others. The thing that makes them particular&shy;ly stupid, though, is that they manage to lose the rest of the flock in a coop that is a healthy size (8"x12").
            </p>

            <p>The poultry farmer is quoted as saying, "I see her, stumbling around and  ba-gawking for her friends, who are about 5 feet from her. It's astounding. 
            </p>

            <p>When one of its flock is attacked, a chicken may know to flee and hide, but it kinda rarely recognizes that it is being chased until <nobr>it is too</nobr> late.</p>

            <p>Although they are great instances of herding behavior in animals, chickens are not always the intelligent, independent thinkers that other <nobr>animals may be.</nobr></p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I can say with certainty that the Chicken Run movies are not documentaries. They are never going to be able to execute a planned escape attempt, they could not possibly construct a nearly finished mechanical flying chicken and hide it within the coop, and they most likely do not have a Scottish accent.</p>
