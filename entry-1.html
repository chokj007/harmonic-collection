		<p> The summer I turned sixteen and got my license, Kyle Lewis was pulled dead from the lake. It was the week before Christmas and heat pressed down over the town. People went to the lake to cool off, but Kyle didn't drown. There was no water in his lungs</p>
		<p> Coming back now, ten years passed, like always when I returned to visit my parents, I found myself slowing down when I reached the lake. The turn off was on the long road which led to their house and then on into town, and I felt myself pulled toward it, as if a magnet lay in the deep centre of it, drawing me. I stopped and got out the car and stood there on the side of the road, looking out toward the water, the shimmer of sun on the still surface.</p>
        <P> The memories rushed back at me. The evenings my father and I spent out in the garage working on the car he'd bought for us to do up together. My sister sobbing at our table and my mother comforting her while my father stood silent. The long days of summer and the police and the rumours people whispered to one another. The swagger of the Ryan brothers around town</p>
        <p> And the last day of Kyle's life, recounted to police by those who'd seen him. That day he'd slept until eleven. He and my sister Taylor had been up late drinking the night before, and when they woke the empty bottles and glasses were still on the bench, the smell of booze hung in the air of their little house.</p>
        <p> They lived on the same long road as my parents did, but further into town. I passed their house each day when I biked home from school, dreaming of the day my car would finally be ready for me.
            Kyle was hungover and he sat on the couch and rolled a cigarette while Taylor made them coffee. She asked him if he wanted anything to eat and he said no, he wasn't hungry. He was quiet and she knew he was worried. He was worried because he owed Dean Ryan and his brother Pete money, and they were getting impatient.</p>
        <p>When told this, the police wanted to know what he owed them for. Taylor said he bought some car parts off Pete Ryan and hadn't paid him yet, but eventually she told them the truth. By then he'd been found and lay cold in the morgue, and she wasn't worried anymore about what might happen to him. It already had.</p>
        <p>The first person narrative essentially envelopes the audeince into their world, simultaneously providing a sense of background. Moreover, the pace and insertion of context aids the flow of the story.</p>
