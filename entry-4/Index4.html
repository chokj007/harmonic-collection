        <h1>Dumb Animals</h1>
        <h2>3.Kakapo</h2> 
        <p>Yeah yeah, I'm using a bird again- lets please move along...</p>
        <p>This one is going to be a short one-short list too, cause they're only two reasons why this bird is so dumb. (You might want to imagine the intensity of these reasons) </p>
        <ol class="pic">
            <li>Kakapo is the world's only flightless parrot. </li>
            <li>They're nocturnal.</li>
            <li>They smell nice.</li>
            <li>They're friendly. </li>
            <li>They're possibly one of the longest-lived birds. (No idea how) </li>
          </ol> 
          <p>One more fact will be given below  </p> 
          
          <p> The Kakapo, a parrot owl native to New Zealand, ranks at the top of animals thought to be the most stupid. 
          </p>
          <p>In short, a large species of flightless bird that lives on the ground at night has little value for its own life. Thus, the stupid part.</p>

          <div>
          <p><strong>Imagine the predator sighting the prey. The predator could advance slowly. Or the animal might sprint quickly over the ground. Doesn't matters. The predator attacks in either scenario. You may imagine the animal as a cat, stoat, rat, or anything else. The Kakapo is the prey. The Kakapo is static. There is no blinking. Even if it notices the attack coming from a different continent.</strong></p>
          <p>The bird froze and is now waiting to be eaten.</p>
          <p>Yes. It just stands still. And is ready to die. Bring your cursor here to look at them.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>â€¦ </h2> 

          <div>
            <p> So they are unable to flee. They don't even want to reproduce, as if that weren't bad enough. It is astounding how bad the Kakapo's mating skills are. The female is left confused and disoriented by the mating call because it is so unpleasant. This makes mating really difficult because nobody appears to know what will happen or what to do. Sadly, and maybe not unexpectedly, there were less than 200 Kakapos on the planet as of 2020.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: they're dumb because they don't want to exist.</h2>
